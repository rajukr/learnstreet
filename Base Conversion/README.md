Welcome! Here is a Base Conversion project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

You are probably familiar with the decimal system, aka base 10, in which each digit of a number is 0-9. But did you know there are other bases, like binary (2), octal (8), hexadecimal (16) and more? In programming, it is sometimes necessary to convert numbers from one base to another? For example, in HTML, colors are represented in hexadecimal. In this project, you will code a base converter that converts numbers from one base to another.

Try it out!
