Welcome! Here is a Conway's Game of Life project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will code some methods to implement a working version of Conway's Game of Life. Invented in the 1970s, the game models how a simple environment, represented by a grid, changes over time according to its initial configuration and a set of basic rules. The grid contains two types of cells: 1) cells that are alive (colored yellow), and 2) cells that are dead (colored grey).

For each generation, the simulation checks to see whether a live cell will continue living, or an empty cell will become populated by a new live individual. This is determined by the number of neighbors surrounding the cell in question (all eight horizontal, vertical and diagonal neighbors are counted for each cell).

For a cell that is 'alive': each cell with one or no neighbours dies, as if they were easier prey for predators. Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.

For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated': each cell with three neighbours becomes populated.

In this project, you will code the rules of when a cell should live or die, as well as auxiliary methods required for the game. Some initial starting configurations have been provided for you and will show you that some really interesting patterns can be produced.

Try it out!
